  <h1 class="my-heading">About Aarav Bajaj</h1>
  <p class="my-text">Dear parent of protégé, or protégé thyself <br> I would love to tutor because I am really passiona... Who am I kidding. Im broke. I encourage you to remember that being broke is a state of mind, not of the pocket. During my time as a former private tutor, believe it or not, I felt fulfilled - As if I were doing something worthwhile. Hey, It's a step up from sitting on the couch and play brawl stars on my mum's Ipad (and yes, I was first in Australia). It was a lot of fun. A year goes by, I get bored of the game and start playign VALORANT on my pc. Ladi-da 2 more years go by and I'm top 4000 global. Let's not get off track. My point is, I've come a long way from a video game addict, to a guy who's literally addicted to math and cubing (3x3, 2x2, OH). Not a day goes by where I collectively spend less than 6 hours. A 15 year old nerd. I guess that's what you can call me. </p>
