  <h1 class="my-heading">About Aarav Bajaj</h1>
  <p class="my-text">Dear parent of protégé, or protégé thyself <br> I would love to tutor because I am really passiona... Who am I kidding. Im broke. I encourage you to remember that being broke is a state of mind, not of the pocket. During my time as a former private tutor, believe it or not, I felt fulfilled - As if I were doing something worthwhile. Hey, It's a step up from sitting on the couch playing brawl stars on my mum's Ipad and VALORANT on my pc (and yes, I was top 10 in Australia for both). It was a lot of fun. Let's not get off track. My point is, I've come a long way from being addicted to pixels, to a guy who's literally obsessed with math and cubing (3x3, 2x2, OH). Not a day goes by where I collectively spend less than 6 hours doing them. A 15 year old nerd. I guess that's what you can call me. <br> <br> My goal is to get into Normanhurst Boys High School in 2024. I am currently reading a book; Atomic Habits by James Clear. He talks about focusing on a system instead of a goal. In this case, study hard would be the system, NBHS would be the goal. His point is, bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. He's right, we should have a system (or routine) in order to make greater progress. We expect progress to be linear, but that line we put ourselves on, it fluctuates. We must do what is right, not because of how we feel, but because it has to be done. After all, my brother always tells me we are what we repeatedly do. </p>
