  <p class="my-text">Dear parent of protégé, or protégé thyself <br> I would love to tutor because I am really passiona... Who am I kidding. Im broke. I encourage you to remember that being broke is a state of mind, not of the pocket. During my time as a former private tutor, believe it or not, I felt fulfilled - As if I were doing something worthwhile. Hey, It's a step up from sitting on the couch and watching brooklyn-99. </p>
